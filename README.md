**How to play**:  
The game will show the numbers, or pieces, left in the "box". Then it will automatically roll the die. The player can type in any combination of numbers (separated by spaces), or a single number, that adds up to the number the die rolled. See example and rules below. The player can choose to end the game for any reaosn with the command "end".

**Rules**:  
At the start of the game all numbers or pieces are "open".

During the game, each player plays in turn. A player begins his or her turn by throwing or rolling the die or dice into the box. If the remaining tile(s) show 6 or lower, the player may roll only one die. Otherwise, the player must roll both dice.

After throwing, the player adds up the pips dots on the dice and then removes one of any combination of open numbers that equals the total number of dots showing on the dice. For example, if the total number of dots is 8, the player may choose any of the following sets of numbers (as long as all of the numbers in the set are available to be covered):  
8  
7, 1  
6, 2  
5, 3  
5, 2, 1  
4, 3, 1  
The player then rolls the dice again, aiming to shut more numbers. The player continues throwing the dice and shutting numbers until reaching a point at which, given the results produced by the dice, the player cannot shut any more numbers. At that point, the player scores the sum of the numbers that are still uncovered. For example, if the numbers 2, 3, and 5 are still open when the player throws a one, the player's score is 10 (2 + 3 + 5 = 10).
