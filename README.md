How to play:  
The game will show the numbers, or pieces, left in the "box". Then it will automatically roll the die. Based on the number that the dir rolled, the player will be able to choose numbers (pieces) to remove from the box. Those numbers then become unavailable for the rest of the game.
Example:  
All pieces in the box are up and the die rolls an 8. The player can decide to put down numbers that add up to an 8, like [8] or [5, 3], or [5, 2, 1]. The player also has the option to end the game if he pleases for any reason.

Rules:  
At the start of the game all numbers or pieces are "open" (cleared, up), showing the numerals 1 to 9.

During the game, each player plays in turn. A player begins his or her turn by throwing or rolling the die or dice into the box. If the remaining tile(s) show 6 or lower, the player may roll only one die. Otherwise, the player must roll both dice.

After throwing, the player adds up the dots on the dice and then "shuts" (closes, covers) one of any combination of open numbers that equals the total number of dots showing on the dice. For example, if the total number of dots is 8, the player may choose any of the following sets of numbers (as long as all of the numbers in the set are available to be covered):

8  
7, 1  
6, 2  
5, 3  
5, 2, 1  
4, 3, 1  
The player then rolls the dice again, aiming to shut more numbers. The player continues throwing the dice and shutting numbers until reaching a point at which, given the results produced by the dice, the player cannot shut any more numbers. At that point, the player scores the sum of the numbers that are still uncovered. For example, if the numbers 2, 3, and 5 are still open when the player throws a one, the player's score is 10 (2 + 3 + 5 = 10).
